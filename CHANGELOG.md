## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- `playbook-code` after a global install (`npm install -g @sublang/playbook ...`) no longer fails with `ClaudeCodeAdapter requires @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`. v0.1.1 added the SDKs as dependencies, but global-install topology puts each top-level package in its own siloed `node_modules/` — so cligent (installed as a separate global package) couldn't walk up to find the SDKs sitting in `@sublang/playbook/node_modules/`. v0.1.2 moves `@sublang/cligent` into `dependencies` so it lands transitively inside playbook's tree; the SDK resolution walk now hits the deps. The single-command install is now `npm install -g @sublang/playbook` (cligent comes along).
- `bin/playbook-code` no longer requires `tmux-play` on `PATH`. The shim now resolves the CLI through `require.resolve('@sublang/cligent/tmux-play')` and execs it via `node`, so it works regardless of whether the user has cligent installed separately.

### Changed

- CI's smoke job now uses a global-prefix install and probes adapter SDK resolution from cligent's installed location — the topology that surfaces the v0.1.1 regression. The previous local-style install hoisted everything into a shared `node_modules/`, masking the bug.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- `playbook-code` no longer fails at runtime with `ClaudeCodeAdapter requires @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` (and the Codex equivalent). The bundled production config wires both adapters, so the SDKs are now declared as direct dependencies of `@sublang/playbook` and install automatically.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- Three-phase playbook compiler stack as specs: `slc/text2gears.md` (prose → GEARS spec items, one per state behavior), `slc/gears2fsm.md` (GEARS → XState v5 finite state machine, one captain-invoking state per item), and `slc/link.md` (FSM → host-agnostic runtime driven by Boss turns through typed ports).
- Reference CODE playbook published as `@sublang/playbook` — a worked end-to-end example of the stack driving a coder / reviewer / committer loop. Source at `reference/sdlc/code.md`; compiled to gears `code.gears.md` (CODE-1..19), FSM `code.fsm.ts`, runtime `code.playbook.ts`, and `tmux-play` adapter `code.tmux-play.ts`.
- Captain-pane status stream with a four-glyph vocabulary (`◆` terminal/idle, `▸` Boss-input echo, `⮕` captain-invoking state entry with label + player + CODE-N + rider fields, `⤷` transition guard with payload tallies). Telemetry stream stays structured under topic `playbook.fsm.state`.
- `playbook-code` CLI bin — launches `tmux-play` with the bundled `tmux-play.production.config.yaml` so end users can run the reference playbook with one command after `npm install -g @sublang/playbook @sublang/cligent`.
- Conformance test suite (386 tests across six files) pinning the gears ↔ FSM 1:1 mapping (PLAYBOOK-1..6), runtime contract (PBRT-5..16), prompt composition, introspect helpers, and onDone arm coverage.
- Package exports `./code/playbook` (the host-agnostic `createPlaybookRuntime` factory) and `./code/tmux-play` (the cligent-bound Captain factory).
